      <description>So I have started a blog. Here you should find write ups on CTFs and machines on HackTheBox and my experiences in the industry as try to improve my skills in cyber security.
I want to start documenting and recording things I learn to help others but also to serve as notes for myself.
I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out and very much a noob so do not expect too much.</description>
