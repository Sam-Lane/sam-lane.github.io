      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s use hashcat to generate a custom word-list we can make use of with password spraying attacks. Users typically have passwords that have a set pattern, such as if a company has a policy of resetting passwords monthly it is not surpring to find that users have their password contain the current Month of the year. Prehaps a companies password policy is longer you could then expect users to use seasons as part of their password.</description>
