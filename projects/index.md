I think I spend more time reading Stackoverflow than I do writing code in my text editor. When I'm working I always have three things open - VScode, a web browser and a terminal. I write my code go to my terminal run it and if an error pops up I am unfamilar with to my web browser I go in the hopes of finding a stackoverflow question that fufills my needs. The annoying part of all this, I have to tab over to my browser open another tab, you can't have too many tabs open, and enter my query. I wanted to streamline this _ever so dedious_ process. I had recently been learning a bit of Javascript and thought I would have ago and writing a command line program that I can type my query into hit enter the browser googles that query for me and makes it my active window.

Shell-search is easy to use. Install it (instructions are on the github) and issue a search with 
```bash
search <query here>
```
