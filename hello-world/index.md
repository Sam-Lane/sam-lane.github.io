# "H3110_W0r1d"



## So I have started a blog.

Here you should find write ups on CTFs and machines on HackTheBox and my experiences in the industry as try to improve my skills in cyber security.

I want to start documenting and recording things I learn to help others but also to serve as notes for myself.

I'm just starting out and very much a noob so do not expect too much.
